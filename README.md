TwitterBot generating Haikus.
Bringing random word poetry to the internet

## Overview
This is a combination of the Wordnik.com API, some code from masnun.com/2015/12/05/creating-a-twitter-retweet-bot-in-python.html and some twitterbot_framework and some botastro and some hubot.  
Or at least I used all of these (successfully and unsuccessfully) while making this version.
I'm not really sure how I could have forked some of all of them into this project on github so I'm creating a new project all together.

## Use
